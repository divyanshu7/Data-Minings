 Problem Statement
Data is of various customers of a bank with their credit limit , the total number of credit cards the customer has , and different channels through which customer has contacted the bank for any queries , different channels include visiting to bank , online and through call centre.

Marketing team plans to display offer ads on digital platform but only wants to target customers who are digitally more active , hence can we built different clusters of different channels so that based on different requirements the marketing team will target only customers falling under a particular cluster rather than targeting all the customers.

Using both Hierarchical (Agglomerative) and Non-Hierarchical (k-means) technique to built clusters.

Note: This data is a completely dummy data and is created for this practical example only, it does not have any relevance to any organization.
